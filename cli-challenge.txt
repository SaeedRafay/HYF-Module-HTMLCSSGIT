1. How do I create a hidden file or folder? How do I display it in the CLI?

$ touch .fileName.txt
to create a hidden file in Linux or Git Bash as it also uses Linux command yet it remains visible in Windows OS GUI

$ attrib +h .fileName.txt
Windows OS does has different way to hide file so this command also hides the file in Windows OS

$ attrib -h .fileName.txt
to remove the hidden attribute from the file in Windows OS so it will be visible in GUI

$ touch .folderName
to create a hidden folder in Linux or Git Bash yet it remains visible in Windows OS GUI

$ attrib +h .folderName
to hide the folder in Windows OS

$ attrib -h .folderName
to remove the hidden attribute from the file in Window OS so it will be visible in GUI

$ ls -a
to display hidden as well as non-hidden files Git Bash



2. How do I create multiple nested directories, like /c/Users/myusername/these/folders/are/just/for/fun?

$ mkdir -p /just/for/fun
in the current directory, this command will create multiple nested subfolders in the order of 'just/for/fun'



3. How do I append a message to a file, without a newline character, so the output would be:
first message
second message

$ echo "first message" >> fileName.txt
$ echo "second message" >> fileName.txt
these commands will append the text in a new line in the file
